Scope of Work – Meta Ads API Read Prover

Objective

Create a small application in the bombe-platform organisation that regularly connects to the Meta Ads Marketing API and performs safe, read-only requests against a real ad account. The purpose is to demonstrate ongoing integration activity so that Meta approves our app for Ads Management Standard Access.

⸻

What the application should achieve
	1.	Authenticate correctly
	•	Use the correct app credentials and system user token that belong to our verified business.
	•	Ensure the token carries the right advertising permissions.
	2.	Connect to a real business ad account
	•	Not the sandbox account.
	•	All requests should be directed at our real account ID.
	3.	Perform a repeatable set of safe calls
	•	Query account metadata, campaigns, ad sets, ads, custom audiences, images, and insights.
	•	Only read data, never create or modify ads.
	•	Handle accounts with no active campaigns (still log success).
	4.	Record the results
	•	Each run should log when requests were made and whether they succeeded.
	•	Logs should be easily accessible for audit or to show Meta as evidence.
	5.	Run automatically on a schedule
	•	Execute multiple times per day without manual input.
	•	Keep running consistently for at least 1–2 weeks to build the integration history Meta requires.
	6.	Be easy to configure and run
	•	Store credentials and account ID outside the code, so we can change them without edits.
	•	Simple instructions for running locally or on a hosted service.

⸻

Deliverables
	•	A new repository under the bombe-platform organisation.
	•	Clear documentation describing:
	•	What the app does and why
	•	How to set it up with our credentials
	•	How to view logs of successful calls
	•	How to schedule it for automatic runs
	•	A working implementation that, once configured, starts making successful read requests and continues without manual supervision.

⸻

Success Criteria
	•	The app consistently returns successful responses (HTTP 200) from the Meta Ads API over several days.
	•	Meta’s review team can see that the app has been making regular Ads API calls.
	•	We can demonstrate integration readiness and re-apply for Ads Management Standard Access.
